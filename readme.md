$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

ESLint was installed locally. We recommend using this local copy instead of your globally-installed copy.

Basic Setup
First let's create a directory, initialize npm, install webpack locally, and install the webpack-cli (the tool used to run webpack on the command line):

mkdir webpack-demo

npm init -y
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-devnpm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@1.2.11 (node_modules/fsevents):
npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@1.2.11: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})

+ webpack@4.41.6

Throughout the Guides we will use diff blocks to show you what changes we're making to directories, files, and code.

Now we'll create the following directory structure, files and their contents:

Create;
./webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          'style-loader',
          'css-loader',
        ],
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|gif|jpeg)$/,
        use: [
          'file-loader',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
